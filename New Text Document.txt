Project Overview
Objective:
To build a machine learning model that segments Fidelity's customer base into distinct groups based on their retirement goals, savings behavior, risk tolerance, and other relevant factors. This segmentation will allow for more personalized retirement planning strategies and better customer engagement.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Data Sources:

Customer Demographics: Age, gender, marital status, income, etc.
Savings Behavior: Historical savings data, contributions to retirement accounts, frequency of deposits, etc.
Investment Preferences: Risk tolerance, preferred investment types (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.), portfolio diversification.
Retirement Goals: Target retirement age, expected retirement expenses, current savings vs. required savings, etc.
Transaction History: Historical transactions related to retirement accounts.
External Data (Optional): Economic indicators, market conditions, etc.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Normalize or standardize numerical data if necessary.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., marital status, investment preferences).
Feature Engineering:

Create new features from the raw data, such as savings-to-goal ratio, investment diversity index, etc.
Aggregate transactional data over time to derive meaningful patterns.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations:
Histograms and box plots for numerical variables (e.g., savings behavior).
Bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables (e.g., investment preferences).
Correlation matrices to understand relationships between features.
Clustering Tendency:
Use techniques like Hopkins Statistic to assess if the data is suitable for clustering.
3. Customer Segmentation Model:
Clustering Algorithms:
Start with K-Means Clustering for an initial segmentation.
Experiment with other algorithms like Hierarchical Clustering or DBSCAN to compare results.
Consider using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality if you have a large number of features.
Evaluation of Clusters:
Use metrics like Silhouette Score or Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Interpret the clusters to understand the defining characteristics of each segment.
4. Segment Profiling:
Analyze Each Cluster:
Describe each segment in terms of demographics, savings behavior, investment preferences, etc.
Identify common characteristics and unique features of each segment.
Develop Personas:
Create customer personas for each segment, detailing their retirement goals, risk profiles, and financial behaviors.
Suggest Tailored Retirement Plans:
For each persona, suggest specific retirement plans or investment strategies that align with their profile.
5. Visualization and Reporting:
Dashboard Creation:
Use tools like Tableau or Power BI to create a dashboard that visualizes the segmentation results and insights.
Include interactive elements like filters to explore different segments.
Final Report:
Summarize the methodology, findings, and recommendations in a detailed report.
Include visualizations that help explain the segments and the suggested strategies.
6. Implementation Considerations:
Automation:
Consider building an automated pipeline that regularly updates the segmentation model as new data comes in.
Integration:
Think about how this model can be integrated into Fidelity’s existing systems for real-time customer interaction and planning.
7. Documentation:
Document all the steps, including data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation.
Clearly explain the rationale behind the chosen methods and any assumptions made.
8. Presentation:
Prepare a presentation that outlines the project’s objectives, methods, key findings, and business implications.
Tailor the presentation for an audience that includes both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
