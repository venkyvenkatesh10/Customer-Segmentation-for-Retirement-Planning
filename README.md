## Objectives

This sample project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to:

1. **Data Engineering:** 
   - Efficiently ingest, process, and manage large datasets to ensure data is clean, organized, and accessible.
   - Implement ETL processes to facilitate ongoing data analysis and modeling.

2. **Data Science:**
   - Apply machine learning and statistical techniques to segment customers and predict behaviors.
   - Develop models to forecast customer transactions and identify at-risk customers.

3. **Data Analytics:**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Create visualizations that communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Marital Status
- **Financial Information:** Annual Income, Monthly Savings, Transaction Amount
- **Behavioral Data:** Risk Tolerance, Preferred Investment Type, Saving Frequency
- **Customer Segmentation:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Investment Strategy, Portfolio Diversification

The data is consolidated into a single file, `merged_raw_data.csv`, for analysis.

## Approach

### Data Engineering

**Data Ingestion:**
- Utilized Apache NiFi to automate the ingestion of data from multiple sources, ensuring that data in various formats (CSV, JSON, databases) was centralized.

**Data Transformation:**
- Employed Apache Spark to clean and transform the raw data, performing tasks such as filtering, aggregation, and feature engineering.

**Data Loading:**
- Loaded the transformed data into a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift) for scalable storage and easy access, with optimized query performance.

### Data Science

**Customer Segmentation:**
- Used K-means clustering to segment customers based on financial behaviors such as spending, savings, and CLTV.

**Predictive Modeling:**
- Developed predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to forecast customer behaviors such as transaction likelihood and churn risk.

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Performed hypothesis testing and time series analysis to explore relationships between variables and predict trends.

### Data Analytics

**Savings Behavior Analysis:**
- **Savings Goal Distribution:** Histogram to visualize customers' savings goals.
- **Saving Frequency:** Bar chart showing how often customers save.
- **Saving Instruments Usage:** Stacked bar chart exploring saving instruments.

**Transaction Behavior Analysis:**
- **Transaction Type Distribution:** Pie chart depicting the split between credit and debit transactions.
- **Transaction Amount by Date:** Line chart identifying spending trends over time.
- **High-Value Transactions:** Scatter plot highlighting significant transactions.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis:**
- **CLTV Distribution:** Histogram analyzing the distribution of customer lifetime values.
- **CLTV Segmentation:** Box plot examining CLTV within different customer segments.

**Cross-Analysis Insights:**
- **Risk Tolerance vs. Investment Strategy:** Heatmap exploring the relationship between risk tolerance and investment choices.
- **Income vs. Preferred Investment Type:** Stacked bar chart showing how income levels influence investment preferences.

## Key Insights and Applications

1. **Personalized Financial Products:** Use customer segmentation to tailor financial products to specific needs.
2. **Predictive Customer Insights:** Implement models to predict significant transactions and identify at-risk customers.
3. **Enhanced Customer Retention:** Focus on high CLTV customers with personalized services and incentives.
4. **Strategic Decision-Making:** Use cross-analysis to inform product offerings and marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

This sample project illustrates the integration of data engineering, data science, and data analytics to provide valuable insights into customer behavior in retirement planning. The methodologies employed ensure that data is reliable, patterns are uncovered, and insights are actionable, allowing financial institutions to develop personalized strategies that enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Implementing real-time data streams for continuous analysis.
- **Advanced Predictive Models:** Deploying machine learning models for ongoing customer segmentation and behavior prediction.
- **Expanded Data Sources:** Incorporating external data sources such as market trends for more comprehensive analysis.
